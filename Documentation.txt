John Garth - June 8

What I've done:
Set up 2D environment
Imported all importable assets (to my knowledge)
Converted Textures to Sprites
Organized Textures/Sprites into folder (Content > Assets > BioRube_Assets)
Rough outline of home screen and first level screen
Scaled backgrounds to 1000x1000
Separated both screens into different levels

What needs to be done:
Scaling - Conversion from units in unity to unreal
Understanding how we would implement the conversion from C# to C++
Understanding click events
Locking camera to only show the specific view of the level
Clean up background textures
Analyze the project in Unity and how it ties things together
