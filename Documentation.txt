John Garth - June 8

What I've done:
Set up 2D environment
Imported all importable assets (to my knowledge)
Converted Textures to Sprites
Organized Textures/Sprites into folder (Content > Assets > BioRube_Assets)
Rough outline of home screen and first level screen
Scaled backgrounds to 1000x1000
Separated both screens into different levels

What needs to be done:
Scaling - Conversion from units in unity to unreal
Understanding how we would implement the conversion from C# to C++
Understanding click events
Locking camera to only show the specific view of the level
Clean up background textures
Analyze the project in Unity and how it ties things together

What I've done:
Reuploaded project in lastest version of Unreal
Set up source control on my personal computer
-- You have to set this up on yours too --
1. Install GitHub and Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Locate your Git folder and find 'git.exe' (should be ~\Git\bin\git.exe)
3. Copy your path (C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git.exe)
4. Open the project
5. Click Source Control between the 'Save' and 'Content' button on the top toolbar
6. Click 'Connect to Source Control'
7. Click the drop down box and select 'git'
8. Paste your path and accept the settings

Clicking the Source Control button and then selecting 'Submit to source control'
